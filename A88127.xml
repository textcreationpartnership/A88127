            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <l>But still the cure was wrought by the art of his whores.</l>
            <l>If not, t'aduance his Lust this Lustfull Elfe</l>
            <l>Had tricks enough whereby to helpe himselfe.</l>
            <pb facs="tcp:156993:4"/>
            <l>A man well knowne in Waterford had neede</l>
            <l>To borrow A hundred pounds, in hope to speed</l>
            <l>Vnto this Reverend Lord he did addresse</l>
            <l>Himselfe, and his sute, which thus he did expresse:</l>
            <l>My Lord <hi>I</hi> oft have tasted of your favour</l>
            <l>And promises to doe me good, which rather</l>
            <l>Induceth me unto this bould request.</l>
            <l>Your Lordship wilbe pleas'd to make me blest</l>
            <l>With the Loane of 100. pound which Ile repay</l>
            <l>Within a month or else on any day</l>
            <l>Your Lordship shall appoint. This courteous Lord</l>
            <l>Answer'd, Sir you shall have it on your word</l>
            <l>And more to doe you good, but let your wife</l>
            <l>Be present, least there should be any strife,</l>
            <l>If you should faile for to repay the same,</l>
            <l>Or <hi>I</hi> for breach of payment should make claime.</l>
            <l>He grants, and goes, shee comes, the mony's ready,</l>
            <l>So is my Lord, And the poore Cuckold's needy.</l>
            <l>Sir saith my Lord, though't be an intire summe,</l>
            <l>It is odd mony that to me is come.</l>
            <l>Amongst it all ther's but one piece of gould,</l>
            <l>That with the rest not easie to be tould,</l>
            <l>Goe draw it out within my study dore,</l>
            <l>Ile trust you there, but will not many more.</l>
            <l>But cause your credits crackt, ile keep the Key,</l>
            <l>The dore being lockt, mean while your wife shal stay</l>
            <l>And talke with me: tis granted, in his seat</l>
            <l>The Bishop mounts, and does the well knowne feat.</l>
            <l>Another when his Lordships watch digrest,</l>
            <l>As he himselfe did alwayes, to a feast</l>
            <l>He invites himselfe: which ended, he requests</l>
            <l>The Goodman of the house (there being no Guests!</l>
            <pb facs="tcp:156993:5"/>
            <l>To spoyle his sport) That he would set his watch</l>
            <l>At his Sunne Dyall, at which he doth catch,</l>
            <l>Proud of such favour, goes without deniall,</l>
            <l>Meane while another's set by his wives noone dyall.</l>
            <l>These are but tricks of youth, now arme your eares</l>
            <l>With patience, for to heare of pallid feares:</l>
            <l>Suppose a Devill from th'infernall Pit,</l>
            <l>More Monsterlike, then ere was Devill yet,</l>
            <l>Contrary to course, taking a male fiend</l>
            <l>To Sodomize with him, such was the mind</l>
            <l>Of this Lord Bishop, he did take a Childe</l>
            <l>By name, not yeares, acting a sinne so vilde,</l>
            <l>As is forenam'd; this Childe a Proctor too,</l>
            <l>Nor him alone, but his Parrator he must doe;</l>
            <l>These and a Thousand like these he hath done,</l>
            <l>Besides endeavouring to eclipse the Sunne</l>
            <l>Of this our Skie, by making Charles waine draw</l>
            <l>Sublunary, by subverting the Law</l>
            <l>Fundamentall, and putting in the place,</l>
            <l>Commission high, Popes Canons, Great Lauds Grace.</l>
            <l>For the subverting of such Devillish plots,</l>
            <l>From staining of our Kingdome with such blots,</l>
            <l>For th'happy raigne of our most Sacred King,</l>
            <l>And those that from that Royall Stocke doe spring,</l>
            <l>For Parliament, and health of Martiall men,</l>
            <l>All Loyall Subjects cry with me, <hi>Amen.</hi>
